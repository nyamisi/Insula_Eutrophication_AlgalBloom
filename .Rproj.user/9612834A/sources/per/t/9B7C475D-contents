## Limitation of the tool

When adding a layer, there are currently no descriptions of the dataset provided. This lack of information makes it challenging for users to understand the nature of each layer and the distinctions between them. Additionally, the absence of units for the datasets within each layer makes it difficult to interpret the numerical values displayed after selecting a particular layer.

To address these issues, I recommend including a brief description for each layer. For instance, if the user selects the **Deviation Indicator** or **Anomaly** layer, there should be a short explanation indicating whether it represents deviations in algal bloom levels, microplastic pollution, chlorophyll concentration or any other relevant variable. Furthermore, specifying the units for these variables would assist users in discerning the differences between them and will interpret the numerical data accurately.
